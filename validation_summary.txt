The text primarily focuses on Spinoza's metaphysical system and does not provide any specific exploration or definition of 'Action'. Therefore, it appears to be mentioned only in passing within the context of the broader discussion.
- Beatitude (page 214): The term 'beatitude' is mentioned in the context of Spinoza's conception of wisdom and beatitude, but it is not explored in detail. The focus is more on the character Bento and his intellectual love of God, rather than a detailed analysis or exploration of the concept of beatitude itself. The term appears to be mentioned in passing as part of a broader discussion on wisdom and intellectual love, rather than being central to the argument or explanation.
- Causation (page 32): The term 'causation' is mentioned in the context of a discussion about Spinoza's philosophical structures, specifically in relation to inherence and conception. However, the text does not provide a detailed analysis or exploration of causation itself. Instead, it is mentioned as part of a list of structures and not as a central focus of the argument.

- Causation (page 144): The term 'causation' is mentioned in the text as part of a broader discussion on the trans-attributal properties of modes, specifically in relation to Spinoza's philosophy. However, the text does not delve into a detailed analysis or exploration of causation itself. Instead, it focuses more on the concept of composition and its role in Spinoza's framework. The mention of causation appears to be in passing, as it is not central to the argument being developed in this particular excerpt. Additionally, the text indicates that the nature of causation was investigated in previous chapters, suggesting that any significant discussion on causation is likely found elsewhere in the book.
- Causation (page 206): The term 'causation' is not explicitly mentioned in the text. The discussion revolves around concepts of power, action, and passions in Spinoza's philosophy, with a focus on the adequation of a mode's causality and its activity.

The focus is more on the composition of individuals and the organic model rather than a detailed exploration of 'totality.'
- Totality (page 209): The term 'totality' is mentioned only once in the text, and it is not central to the argument or explanation. It appears in the context of discussing Spinoza's concept of the 'free man' and his relation to the whole of Nature, but it is not defined, analyzed, or explored in detail. The focus of the text is on the figures of 'homo liber' and 'sapiens' and their roles in Spinoza's ethical framework, rather than on the concept of totality itself.
- whole of Nature (page 209): The term 'whole of Nature' is mentioned in the context of Spinoza's epistemology, specifically in relation to the concept of the 'free man' (homo liber). It is used to illustrate that reason is compatible with individuality and does not require identification with the totality of Nature.

However, the text does not provide a detailed analysis or exploration of the concept of duration itself. It appears to be mentioned in passing as part of a broader discussion on Spinoza's epistemology, rather than being central to the argument or explanation. Therefore, it is not significantly discussed.
- Duration (page 181): The term 'duration' is discussed in the context of Spinoza's philosophy, specifically in relation to the concept of causal action and the reconfiguration of the total individual. It is not merely mentioned in passing but is part of a detailed explanation of how Spinoza's total individual can act causally through discrete instants of duration. This indicates that 'duration' is central to the argument being made about Spinoza's philosophy.

Although the discussion is not exhaustive, the mention of God is not merely in passing or as an example, but rather as a central element of the philosophical argument being critiqued.
- Individual (page 167): The term 'individual' is mentioned only once in the text, and it appears in the context of a citation related to the 'ratio of motion and rest necessary for the preservation of an individual.' This mention is not central to the argument or explanation of the text, which focuses on the metaphor of the worm and its cognitive capacities in relation to human understanding. The term 'individual' is not defined, analyzed, or explored in detail, nor is it used in developing a key point. Therefore, it is not significantly discussed.
- Individual (page 209): The term 'individual' is not significantly discussed in the text.

While the text touches on the 'face of the whole universe,' which could imply a notion of totality, the term itself is not defined, analyzed, or central to the argument. The focus is more on the composition of individuals and the organic model rather than a detailed exploration of 'totality.'
- Totality (page 209): The term 'totality' is mentioned only once in the text, and it is not central to the argument or explanation. It appears in the context of discussing Spinoza's concept of the 'free man' and his relation to the whole of Nature, but it is not defined, analyzed, or explored in detail. The focus of the text is on the figures of 'homo liber' and 'sapiens' and their roles in Spinoza's ethical framework, rather than on the concept of totality itself.
- whole of Nature (page 209): The term 'whole of Nature' is mentioned in the context of Spinoza's epistemology, specifically in relation to the concept of the 'free man' (homo liber). It is used to illustrate that reason is compatible with individuality and does not require identification with the totality of Nature.
