13.1 Insects: The Old Received Wisdom
The entomologist Harold Bastin, in a 1927 Scientiﬁc American article, 
reported that insects will continue to feed and mate despite catastrophic 
injury, such as the loss of the abdomen. The piece was studded with graphic 
photographs: a dragonﬂy eating its own detached abdomen, a wasp without 
an abdomen feeding on sugar syrup, which drips out from the back of its 
thorax, a sleeping moth that is not woken by being pinned to a tree.1
Half a century later, another entomologist, V.  B.  Wigglesworth, oﬀered 
reﬂections along similar lines:
For the most part insects behave as though their integument is insensitive to 
pain. They show no manifestation of pain on cutting the cuticle: they can-
not cry out, but they do not ﬂinch or run. Whereas a nip with forceps is very 
painful to us, a caterpillar treated in this way shows no sustained signs of 
agitation.2
And C. H. Eisemann and colleagues further reinforced these observations:
No example is known to us of an insect showing protective behavior towards 
injured body parts, such as by limping afer leg injury or declining to feed or 
mate because of general abdominal injuries. On the contrary, our experi-
ence has been that insects will continue with normal activities even afer 
severe injury or removal of body parts. An insect walking with a crushed 
tarsus, for example, will continue applying to the substrate with undimin-
ished force. Among our other observations are those on a locust which con-
tinued to feed whilst itself being eaten by a mantis; aphids continuing to 
feed whilst being eaten by coccinellids; a tsetse ﬂy which ﬂew in to feed 
although half- dissected; caterpillars which continue to feed whilst tachinid
