We should, in fact, aim for a situation in which the problematic PVS/MCS 
distinction carries no clinical signi8cance and can be retired. All decisions 
should be based on the best interests of the patient, taking all relevant infor-
mation into account, including information about their individual pro8le of 
responsiveness and capacity, and regarding continuing a!ective experiences 
as a realistic possibility.
In some cases, the decision- making team (including clinicians and fam-
ilies) is in agreement that sustaining life inde8nitely is not in the patient’s best 
interests. Here too, the decision should be based on comprehensive best- 
interests assessment sensitive to the details of the case, and not on the PVS/
MCS distinction.
The method of withdrawing clinically assisted nutrition and hydration 
(CANH) would not be acceptable for any other sentient being, and alterna-
tives must be explored and discussed by inclusive, democratic processes. Part 
of the problem is that clinicians fear prosecution if they administer large 
doses of sedatives or analgesics aAer CANH withdrawal. In cases where 
CANH withdrawal has already been authorized, clinicians should be guaran-
teed that hastening death in this way will not lead to punishment. If alterna-
tive methods were available, it would better enable clinicians and patient’s 
families to watch and wait during the early days aAer a traumatic brain injury, 
rather than moving quickly towards a decision to withdraw treatment before 
a patient’s condition has stabilized.
