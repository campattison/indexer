The four tests introduce a division of labour between the panel and its 
expert advisers. At each stage, the expert advisers provide on- demand input 
regarding the likely consequences of diﬀerent policy options, but it falls to 
ordinary citizens to debate the central evaluative questions. These questions can 
be easily understood and do not require arbitrating scientiﬁc disagreements.
A government is the ideal implementing agent for such a process, but other 
organizations (e.g. universities) can conduct similar processes. The process 
may be approximated in other, non- ideal ways, such as by a small panel (or even 
a single individual) reﬂecting on whether their decisions could be justiﬁed to 
a more inclusive panel implementing the full process.
In these debates, those with expertise in philosophy can bring their ex pert ise 
to bear by explaining and elucidating value conﬂicts, mapping out consistencies 
and inconsistencies between diﬀerent positions, and making proposals. These 
roles can be played without claiming additional, sage- like expertise over the 
correct way to resolve conﬂicts between deeply held values.
