These questions do require members of the public to grasp the concept of risk, 
at the sort of level that might be required to complete a risk assessment form. 
They need to be able to understand risk as something that comes in degrees 
and that may be reduced by degrees. Some minimal training regarding the 
concept of risk (not in any way speciﬁc to the present risk) may be needed for 
the panel to function eﬀectively. But no detailed scientiﬁc or mathematical 
knowledge is needed to debate the above questions and to apply one’s values 
to the issues at stake.
Indeed, there is a sense in which people who do not have specialist prior 
knowledge are better placed to judge whether the harms and costs imposed 
by a precaution can be justiﬁed to those aﬀected, since those aﬀected will tend 
to lack specialist prior knowledge too. If the justiﬁcation is incomprehensible 
to those aﬀected, it is not truly justifying the harms and costs to them; it is 
merely justifying those harms and costs to an idealized image of them.
