a high- pro8le study from Jan Claassen and colleagues tested an EEG- based 
technique on 104 patients with disorders of consciousness.14 A machine 
learning algorithm (a support vector machine classi8er) was tasked with 
guessing, on the basis of a bedside EEG recording of a patient, the spoken 
commands the patient had been given. The commands given were ‘keep 
opening and closing your right[/lef] hand’ and ‘stop opening and closing 
your right[/lef] hand’.1B For each patient, the classi8er’s performance was 
evaluated by comparing its guesses about the spoken commands (as 
inferred from the EEG) to the actual commands. The headline result: in 
16/104 patients, signi8cantly above- chance classi8er performance was 
obtained, leading the authors to the striking conclusion that ‘of the 104 
patients, 16 (15%) had cognitive–motor dissociation detected on at least 
one recording’.1C
Concerns about false negatives remain, of course: some unresponsive 
patients may be conscious and yet unable to form even very simple motor 
commands. However, there is also a risk of false positives. This risk arises 
from the fact that, despite the sophistication of modern machine learning, 
a patient responding to commands can still be easily confused with ran-
dom statistical noise. ‘Above- chance’ classi8er performance will sometimes 
be explained by responding but will sometimes be explained by random 
variation— a string of lucky guesses. Claassen and colleagues themselves 
observe in their supplementary information that, since 104 patients were 
studied, ‘it is likely that amongst the 16 CMD patients, 8ve were classi8ed 
as CMD because of statistical 7uctuations rather than actual spoken com-
mand following’.1F
These notes of caution are not reasons to stop developing and using EEG- 
and neuroimaging- based techniques. They are, however, reasons not to see 
these techniques as a panacea that can make our uncertainty go away. They 
can help us obtain relevant evidence that shiAs probabilities— a strong reason 
to develop and use them— but agonizing uncertainty will remain and will 
need to be carefully managed.1G

1B The algorithm was trained separately on each patient. This is called an ‘individualized classi8er’ 
approach, since the classi8er is trained anew on every patient’s personal EEG data. This strategy can 
be contrasted with a ‘general classi8er’ approach that seeks to generalize from a training set of patients 
to a new patient.
