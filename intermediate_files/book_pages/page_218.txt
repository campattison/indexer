unease at the idea of a miniature model of the human brain constructed from 
human brain tissue. Sometimes unease is a bias we should try to overcome. 
But sometimes it is pointing us in the direction of genuine moral reasons to 
pause the research.
We need to think seriously about which of these possibilities is the case here. 
In recent years, a number of bioethicists have been doing just that.4 I have 
weighed into the debate already, advocating for a precautionary approach to 
these issues.? But, as emphasized in Chapter 8, a crucial part of a precaution-
ary approach to any issue is consistency in our thinking about diﬀerent risks, 
and we need to make sure our approach to organoids is fully consistent with 
our approach to animal research. In particular, we must be careful not to be 
overcautious regarding organoids in a way that undermines their promise as 
replacements for animals. My goal here is to ﬁnd the right balance.
11.2 No Risk of Sentience?
I want to start by considering possible reasons to think current neural orga-
noids (at the time of writing) are not sentience candidates. A simple reason 
ofen given is their size. This is not a persuasive reason. Bees have around 
1 million neurons, and (as I will argue in Chapter 13) they are sentience 
candidates. There are existing neural organoids of a similar size, in terms 
of  neuron count, and researchers aim to create organoids with around 
10 million neurons.6
A second simple reason, in my view more on- target than the ﬁrst, is that 
organoids are not complete living organisms. They are disembodied pieces of 
tissue, and a default attitude of scepticism towards the idea of sentient tissue, 
outside of any living animal, is appropriate. Neuroscientists have experi-
mented with small samples of cortical tissue for many years without anyone 
suggesting a risk of sentience. Just as there is a meta- consensus around the 
idea that spinal cords alone are not sentient, there is a meta- consensus around 
the idea that ordinary tissue samples are not sentient either. We must ask: 
given that cortical tissue samples are not ordinarily sentience candidates, 
what is diﬀerent about this new type of cortical tissue that should cause us to
