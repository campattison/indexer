welfare should be driven by markers of sentience, not by markers of intelli-
gence or by brain size.
That said, even when we restrict our focus to markers of sentience, octo-
puses are clearly sentience candidates. I led a review in 2021 that considered 
the evidence of sentience in cephalopod molluscs (octopuses, squid, cuttle-
ﬁsh, and nautiluses) and decapod crustaceans (including many crabs, lob-
sters, crayﬁsh, and shrimps). We constructed a framework based on eight 
theoretically well- motivated criteria. We reported with high conﬁdence that 
octopuses satisﬁed at least seven of the eight criteria.
More broadly, we found a complicated evidential picture. The question of 
when enough evidence has amassed to imply a realistic possibility of sen-
tience that it would be irresponsible to ignore is a diﬃcult judgement call. In 
my view, the coleoid cephalopods and decapods of the Pleocyemata suborder 
are clear sentience candidates, whereas decapods of the Dendrobranchiata 
suborder (including penaeid shrimps) are investigation priorities.
