For example, a study of goldﬁsh showed :exible trade- oﬀs, in which the ﬁshes 
had to choose whether to risk an electric shock in order to access food, and 
made the decision based on both the intensity of the expected shock and 
their level of food deprivation.1D This combination of neural and behavioural 
evidence establishes the teleosts as sentience candidates (and remember the 
bar is not certainty or knowledge, but a realistic possibility supported by 
evidence).
What of non- teleost ﬁshes? While around 96 per cent of ﬁsh species are 
teleosts, that still leaves 4 per cent, and there is very little behavioural evi-
dence concerning the cartilaginous ﬁshes (elasmobranchs, such as sharks and 
rays) and jawless ﬁshes (lampreys and hagﬁsh). Some have claimed that 
elasmo branchs lack nociceptors, and so lack even the most basic prerequisite 
of pain.11 However, two notes of caution are important here. The ﬁrst is that 
these claims are probably incorrect. There are two main types of nociceptive 
neuron in mammals, AE-ﬁbres and C- ﬁbres. AE-ﬁbres, linked to sharp pains 
in us but also used for mechanoreception, have been found in elasmobranchs 
by at least three studies.12 Evidence of C- ﬁbres, associated with lingering 
pains in us, was obtained for the ﬁrst time by a study of sharks in 2022, but 
the C- ﬁbres were speciﬁcally responding to nociceptive stimuli in the cranial 
region.13 We should not be surprised by this, since nociceptors in the cranial 
area were found a long time ago in lampreys, a more basal vertebrate group, 
and nociception has been found in many invertebrates too, even the nema-
tode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (see §13.3).1( It is entirely possible, then, 
that sharks do feel pain. It could be that they only feel pain in response to 
injury around the head (where they can do something about it, by releasing 
prey). Most sharks need to swim to breathe, afer all, and an ability to feel 
pain in parts of the body they cannot rest would have limited adaptive value. 
The second note of caution is that, even if elasmobranchs do not feel pain, 
they may still be sentient in other ways, because sentience is not just pain. 
Other valenced experiences also matter. We will revisit this point in the next 
chapter, when considering insects.

for reviews of the evidence from teleost ﬁsh. See also Mason and Lavery (2022) for a methodological 
critique of the ﬁsh work. In my view, their criticisms highlight the continuing room for reasonable 
doubt, but do not undermine the idea that ﬁsh are sentience candidates (i.e. that there is a realistic 
possibility of sentience that it would be irresponsible to ignore in practical contexts).

nociceptors in the lamprey spinal cord too, but this was subsequently contested (Christenson et al. 
1988). On nociception in nematodes, see Krzyzanowski et al. (2016).
