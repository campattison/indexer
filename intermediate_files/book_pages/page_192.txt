10.1 The Cautionary Tale of Newborn Pain
In the late 1980s, pain in neonates (newborn babies) was a source of major 
public controversy on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1985, Jill Lawson’s pre-
term baby, Jeﬀrey, died ﬁve weeks afer undergoing hours of surgery to repair 
a heart defect. In the afermath of the tragedy, Lawson was horriﬁed to learn 
that Jeﬀrey had been given no anaesthetic or pain relief— only a paralytic to 
stop him moving.
Lawson wrote a letter of protest to the journal Birth, in which she recounted 
appalling details (and I warn the reader that this testimony is distressing):
Jeﬀrey had holes cut on both sides of his neck, another cut in his right chest, 
an incision from his breastbone around to his backbone, his ribs pried apart, 
and an extra artery near his heart tied oﬀ. This was topped oﬀ with another 
hole cut in his lef side. The operation lasted hours. Jeﬀrey was awake 
through it all. The anesthesiologist paralyzed him with Pavulon, a drug that 
lef him unable to move, but totally conscious. When I questioned the anes-
thesiologist later she said Jeﬀrey was too sick to tolerate powerful anesthet-
ics. Anyway, she said, it had never been demonstrated to her that premature 
babies feel pain.1
There have been sombre moments in researching this book, moments where 
I just had to pause and reﬂect on what I had just read, and this was one of 
them.
Lawson’s horror was compounded by a further discovery: this was not 
generally considered poor surgical practice. Operating without anaesthetic 
on neonates was widespread. Lawson launched a campaign to change that 
situation, attracting wide public support.

attention to this passage from Lawson’s letter. A more detailed history of the controversy is given by 
Wei (2016).
