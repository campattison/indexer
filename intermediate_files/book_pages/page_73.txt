experience is associated with a form of self- monitoring, whereby perceptual 
representations are tagged as reliable or unreliable guides to the state of the 
external world right now.IH Intuitively at least, this process of metacognitive 
tagging either does or does not occur: as with a checked bag at an airport, a 
tag is either attached or not attached. In contrast to global broadcasting, the 
presence/absence of a metacognitive tag is not something that obviously

Fig. 3.2 The central idea of the global (neuronal) workspace theory of 
consciousness. Many local processors compete for access to a central workspace 
that integrates content and broadcasts it back to the input systems and onwards to 
a range of consumer systems. The theory ﬁts well with a deep gradualist view of 
the evolution of consciousness, since the architecture of the global workspace is 
likely to vary in many ways across species, and the theory does not posit any 
sharp threshold at which the broadcasting is no longer ‘global’ enough to support 
consciousness. Drawing by Oryan Zacks (from Zacks and Jablonka (2023),
