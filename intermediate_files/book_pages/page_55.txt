a special kind of predictive processing,1H an attention schema,1I or perceptual 
reality monitoring.1K However, the idea of consciousness turning out to be a 
single natural kind is much more general than any of these speciﬁc proposals, 
which could all be incorrect. The fundamental commitment is simply that 
consciousness has a causal role in producing a distinctive cluster of correlated 
markers.1L These markers (beginning with, but not limited to, verbal reports 
of experiences) are akin to the symptoms of a disease: they tend to occur 
together for an underlying reason, such as a single neural mechanism that 
reliably produces all of them. By studying the cluster of markers and its 
causes, we will eventually be able to make a theoretical identiﬁcation: phe-
nom enal consciousness is that mechanism responsible for the cluster of 
markers.
How does this di!er from a ‘many kinds’ view? Daniel Dennett’s essay on 
the ‘magic’ of consciousness provides an informal statement of such a view. 
Dennett writes: ‘In a proper theory of consciousness, the Emperor is not just 
deposed, but exposed, shown to be a cunning conspiracy of lesser operatives 
whose activities jointly account for the “miraculous” powers of the Emperor.’1O 
He tells the story of The Tuned Deck, a magic trick that was in fact many dif-
ferent magic tricks, with a new one brought in to throw spectators o! the 
scent each time they seemed close to guessing the secret. ‘The trick, in its 
entirety, is in the name of the trick, “The Tuned Deck”, and more speciﬁcally, 
in one word “The”!’2P
This sketches a picture on which ‘consciousness’, even when we specify that 
we mean phenomenal consciousness, gestures indeterminately towards a 
plur al ity of neurobiological/cognitive kinds. As Ian Phillips has noted, 
Dennett’s analogizing of consciousness to ‘fame in the brain’ suggests a similar 
picture, since fame is not a phenomenon associated with a single, uniﬁed 
mechanism: there are many routes to fame.21 Dennett’s fondness for magician 
analogies has led him to embrace the term ‘illusionism’ for his view,22

1I Graziano (2013). Graziano’s ‘attention schema’ theory is hard to classify. On the face of it, 
Graziano identiﬁes conscious content with the content of the attention schema. Yet sometimes he 
makes comments that sound sceptical of there being such a thing as consciousness as at all, e.g. ‘Let 
me as clear as possible: consciousness doesn’t happen. It’s a mistaken construct’ (Graziano 2016a). 
See Graziano (2016b) and Kammerer (2018) for discussion of this tension.
