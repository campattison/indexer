These ideas (the concept of a sentience candidate and the duty to avoid 
gratuitous suﬀering) are combined in the principle that precautions may be 
proportionate whenever a being is a sentience candidate. This leaves the issue 
of what proportionality requires, and we should expect disagreement about 
this. All can agree, however, on the unacceptability of a free- for- all in which 
everyone can treat sentience candidates however they wish. To avoid this, we 
need informed and inclusive democratic processes to reach decisions on pro-
portionality, which can then be revisited periodically and whenever signiﬁ-
cant new evidence emerges. The question of what sort of process might ﬁt the 
brief of being ‘informed, inclusive, and democratic’ will be taken up in the 
next two chapters.
This framework is ‘precautionary’ in the sense that it endorses several of 
the core tenets of precautionary thinking: we should not let scientiﬁc uncer-
tainty paralyse decision- making, precautions should be proportionate to the 
threat, our procedures for debating precautions should be democratic and 
inclusive, and the evidential bar for triggering those procedures should be 
set reasonably low. However, the case for adopting this framework does not 
assume any prior sympathy for precautionary approaches to other 
problems.
