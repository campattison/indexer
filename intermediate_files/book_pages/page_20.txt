zone, as diﬃcult as that may be. So, the ﬁrst step towards a good framework is 
to map out that zone.!?
In doing this, I will be trying to take a step back from my own personal 
opinions. Among the reasonable views, there are those I see as more or less 
likely (and I think my opinions will come across) but access to the zone of 
reasonable disagreement does not require my stamp of approval. It is funda-
mentally about whether the view is shaped by, and responds to, evidence 
andGargument.
1.6 A Note on Inﬂuences
I imagined, years ago, a book that would begin with a general discussion of 
precautionary thinking and the science- policy interface and would only then 
zoom in on the special case of sentience. I came to see that this was the wrong 
approach. Intellectually wrong, because I think the reasons that drive precau-
tionary thinking about sentience are ‘bottom- up’ rather than ‘top- down’ in 
the sense just explained. But also not true to the trajectory of my own think-
ing. For me, worrying about sentience has been at the core of this project 
from the beginning. So, this book maintains a relentless focus on sentience.
An upshot is that there is no natural place for me to acknowledge some of 
the inﬂuences on my approach from the wider philosophical and ‘science 
studies’ literature, so I want to do that at the outset. The literature on other 
precautionary principles is a major inﬂuence, especially the work of Daniel 
Steel, Stephen John, and Andy Stirling.2H The literature on values in science 
and inductive risk has also shaped my approach, notably the work of Heather 
Douglas.2! So has the literature on the proper relationship between science 
and policy in a democratic society, in particular the work of Philip Kitcher 
and Sandra Mitchell.22 The deliberative democracy literature, and especially 
!? Federico Zuolo (2020) has undertaken a related task, mapping out reasonable disagreement in 
the speciﬁc case of the human treatment of other animals. The zone of reasonable disagreement about 
the edge of sentience is in some dimensions rather wider. It includes, for example, disagreement about 
substrate neutrality vs sensitivity (§3.5).

who have criticized ‘the precautionary principle’ as a general decision rule, such as Carter and 
Peterson (2015); Sunstein (2005); and Thoma (2022a). Their criticisms dissuaded me from arguing 
for precautions in a top- down fashion.
