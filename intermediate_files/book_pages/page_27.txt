2.2 ‘Phenomenal Consciousness’ as Unstable  
Common Ground
Fi6y years a6er Nagel’s paper, it is still common to de!ne ‘phenomenal con-
sciousness’ in terms of the phrase ‘what it’s like’. A state (e.g. the state of a bat 
echolocating as it swoops down upon its prey) is said to be phenomenally 
conscious if and only if there is something it’s like to be in that state. I cannot 
believe that Nagel, when using the phrase, ever expected it to end up carrying 
so much theoretical weight.
‘What it’s like’ is not really a de!nition at all, as even its proponents o6en 
point out. What it does is draw our attention to a central and mysterious 
aspect of our mental lives, one that seems to elude any attempt at 
Valence
States that “feel good” or
“feel bad”, such as
pleasure and pain
Sentience
(narrow sense)
Valenced conscious
experience
Phenomenal consciousness
“raw feels”
Sentience
(broad sense)
Sapience
Human-level intelligence
Selfhood
A unified, persisting self
Consciousness
Ordinary sense of the word can
refer to any or all of these
Fig. 2.1 Mapping diﬀerent senses of ‘sentience’ and ‘consciousness’. Sentience in 
a broad sense is the capacity for conscious experience, where ‘phenomenal 
consciousness’ is the pertinent sense of consciousness. Sentience in a narrower 
sense adds the further condition that at least some of the conscious experiences 
must be valenced. In neither sense does sentience imply sapience or sel?ood.
