recordings in the brachial connectives, linking the arm nerve cords to the 
brain, showed a prolonged period of high activity afer the noxious stimulus, 
silenced by the lidocaine (Fig. 12.1). All of this is exactly what one would pre-
dict on the hypothesis that the acetic acid causes an aversive experience that 
the lidocaine relieves.

Fig. 12.1 A key ﬁgure from Crook (2021). The experiment (which is relevant to 
our criteria 4, 5, and 8) involved four groups of animals (with either seven or 
eight in each group): a group injected with only saline solution; a second group 
injected with acetic acid; a third group injected with acetic acid and, later, 
lidocaine; and a fourth group (not shown) injected with saline and then 
lidocaine. Afer receiving acetic acid, the aﬀected animals showed directed 
self- protective behaviour, increased neural activity, and avoidance of the chamber 
where they had received it. Lidocaine silenced the heightened neural activity and 
stopped the self- protective behaviour. The ﬁgure, by Robyn Crook, is CC- BY-
