adequate, reasonably necessary, and consistent. Many readers may disagree 
with my speciﬁc proposals, but I hope everyone can agree with that general

The need for action and decision focuses minds, puts limits on specula-
tion, and forces us to make judgements— judgements about what counts as 
evidence of sentience and how that evidence should guide us. But the urgency 
of the problems does not imply a need to rush. Good decisions come not 
from rushing, nor from procrastinating, but from taking the right amount of 
time. When faced with the disturbing and ofen terrible problems at the edge 
of sentience, we need to be prepared to act fast— but we also need to make 
time to reﬂect, deliberate, and listen to views from across the full range of 
reasonable disagreement. And we must do this while ensuring that the 
 sentience candidates themselves remain at the centre of the picture.
