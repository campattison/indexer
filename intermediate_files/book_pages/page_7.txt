A Walk along the Edge
We all eventually fall from the edge of sentience. If we are lucky, the transition 
will be sharp and sudden. If we are not, we may spend years on the brink as 
more fortunate souls debate whether we are sentient or not. When their 
judgement is mistaken, the consequences can be terrible.
Consider Kate Bainbridge.! At age 26, she contracted encephalomyelitis, 
inﬂammation of the brain and spinal cord. For around ﬁve months, she was 
unresponsive but still had sleep- wake cycles, a condition called a prolonged 
disorder of consciousness. She was given a tracheostomy and a feeding tube, 
but no one explained this to her, because she was presumed unconscious. 
Bainbridge came back from the edge. When she regained responsiveness, and 
(later) the ability to communicate via a keyboard, she was able to report that 
her clinician’s presumption had been false. Her testimony is, in places, 
harrowing:
I can’t tell you how frightening it was, especially suction through the mouth. 
I tried to hold my breath to get away from all the pain. They never told me 
about my tube. I wondered why I did not eat.2
Bainbridge’s testimony was written to be heard, ampliﬁed, repeated. It sends a 
resounding message: never simply presume the absence of sentience in a case 
where it could realistically be present. And in the face of uncertainty, do not 
treat a potentially sentient being as if they felt nothing.
This is a book about how our practices and ways of thinking need to 
change, across many areas, once we face up to this principle.
! I learned about this case via Syd Johnson’s (2022) book on the ethics of managing disorders of 
consciousness, which relates the case in more detail. The case was originally documented by Wilson 
and Gracey (2001).
