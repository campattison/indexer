for the layman’s cognitive structure for aﬀect and for the actual structure of 
aﬀective experience’.11
In Russell’s original study, subjects were given twenty- eight common emo-
tion words and asked to group them by similarity in a series of grouping 
tasks, and the clustering patterns were analysed. The clustering pattern 
formed a circle in 2D space, aligning well with Russell’s proposed structure. 
For example, the sequence ‘alarmed, afraid, tense, distressed, annoyed, frus-
trated, miserable, sad, depressed, bored, droopy, tired’ could be represented 
as a long arc through the ‘negative valence’ region of the space, starting at the 
high- arousal end and !nishing at the low- arousal end, with states at the

arranged in a space de!ned by the axes of valence and arousal. The dimensions 
do not account for all diﬀerences between emotions, but they aim to capture the
