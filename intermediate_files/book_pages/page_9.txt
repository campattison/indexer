generate just the right amount of friction. My conscious experiences are, it 
seems, the tip of an iceberg of unconscious computation.
Given this, we can always wonder, for any other animal: do they too 
have a subjective point of view? Or do they just have the unconscious side 
of what I have: the underwater part of the iceberg? As we look across the 
animal kingdom, all of us have our own threshold of doubt: the point at 
which an animal becomes so evolutionarily distant from humans, and so 
dissimilar, that hesitancy to ascribe sentience to it begins to creep in. For a 
small minority, even other mammals evoke some doubt, especially once 
we look beyond the primates.7 I must say, however, that I have met very 
few people who can sustain a doubt that at least all mammals (like cats, 
dogs, and rats) are sentient.

frontal cortex (e.g. Rolls 2004).
