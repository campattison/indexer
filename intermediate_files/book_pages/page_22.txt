It is worth studying these cases together not because there is a moral 
equiva lence between them but because they present us with similar types of 
uncertainty. We need frameworks for helping us to manage that uncertainty 
and reach decisions. This book aims to develop a consistent precautionary 
framework that enshrines— but also goes beyond— the insight that we must 
err on the side of caution in these cases, take proportionate steps to manage 
risk, and avoid reckless or negligent behaviour. Where sentience is in doubt, 
we should give these systems the beneﬁt of the doubt. What that means in 
practice will be considered in the rest of the book.
