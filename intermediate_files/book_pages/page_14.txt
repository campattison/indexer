statistically signiﬁcant improvement in performance, with more hits per 
minute and longer rallies. The performance was not good in absolute terms, 
unsurprisingly, but it is remarkable enough that performance measurably 
improved. The system learned. There was no evidence, however, of the 
learning being retained between sessions. In each session of ‘gameplay’, the 
system learned anew.
The researchers’ claim about ‘sentience’ merits scepticism. They deﬁned 
sentience as ‘responsiveness to sensory impressions through adaptive internal 
processes’ and counted electrical stimulation through the array as a sensory 
impression. This is a deﬁnition so minimal that it trivializes the idea of sen-
tience, detaching it entirely from conscious experience and the mind. I see it 
as a mistake to deﬁne sentience in this way. DishBrain is indeed sentient in 
this minimal sense, but all living cells, including those of brain- dead humans, 
would also be likely to count as sentient in this sense, and this should give us 
pause. These issues of deﬁnition will be picked up again in the next chapter. 
For now, I will just say that I think it is important to deﬁne sentience in a way 
that makes the concept apt for its important role in ethics and policy. We 
should take care not to trivialize it.
