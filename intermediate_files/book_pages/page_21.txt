the work of Helene Landemore, Alexander Guerrero, and John Dryzek, has 
also leE a signiﬁcant mark.21 And I have been inspired by analyses of very 
di;erent cases by Anna Alexandrova (on well- being), Richard Bradley and 
Katie Steele (on climate change), Tim Lewens (on mitochondrial donation), 
and Anya Plutynski (on cancer screening).27 I am highlighting these authors 
here because they have not written directly on the topic of sentience— those 
who have will be acknowledged in later chapters.
When I ﬁrst wrote about sentience and the precautionary principle, in 
2017, more than twenty commentators kindly o;ered responses to my argu-
ments.2: When I wrote another target article (with Andrew Crump, Alexandra 
Schnell, Charlotte Burn, and Heather Browning) in 2022, this time on sen-
tience in decapod crustaceans, we received thirty commentaries.26 These 
critical responses have ended up shaping my thinking in important ways. 
IGam very grateful to the editor of Animal Sentience, Stevan Harnad, for facili-
tating this process, and for his tireless work to encourage everyone to think 
more carefully about contested cases of sentience.
1.7 Summary of Chapter 1
There is a family of cases at the edge of sentience. In these cases, grave deci-
sions hinge on whether we regard sentience— initially introduced, informally, 
as ‘ethically signiﬁcant experience’—to be present or absent in a person, ani-
mal, or other cognitive system. The family includes people with disorders of 
consciousness, embryos and fetuses, neural organoids, other animals (espe-
cially invertebrates), and AI technologies that reproduce brain functions and/
or mimic human behaviour.
