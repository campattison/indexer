commitment: the commitment that the vertebrate core control system suf-
:ces for sentience in virtue of the general type of computations it performs 
(i.e. simulations of the right kind), and not in virtue of the :ne details of the 
algorithms used, nor in virtue of how those algorithms are neurally imple-
mented (that is, we need R5, in the reasonable range mapped out in Chapter 6). 
We need, in other words, not just computational functionalism, but what 
(in Chapter 3) I called large- scale computational functionalism, on which the 
precise algorithms are unimportant. This is a background commitment that 
many will doubt (e.g. those who favour R1, R2, or R4), but it is part of the 
zone of reasonable disagreement. It is a realistic possibility that sentience can 
be achieved in multiple ways with only relatively liberal constraints on its 
algorithmic and neural implementation. So, evidence that the insect central 
complex performs the same general type of computation as the vertebrate 
midbrain is another reason to take seriously the possibility of sentience in 
insects.
Working Memory, Attention and Sophisticated 
Associative Learning
A diﬀerent way to make a case for sentience candidature in some insects 
appeals to evidence of working memory and attention, relying on the idea of 
a close relationship between these mechanisms and sentience, at least when 
found in biological brains.17 The ability of bees and Drosophila fruit ﬂies to 
attend selectively to some stimuli over others is well documented and central 
to their learning skills.1B There is also substantial evidence of working mem-
ory in bees, revealed by standard tests that were :rst developed to test for 
working memory in mammals. One involves a radial arm maze, in which 
many arms can be accessed from a central atrium. Honey bees (Apis mellif-
era) display working memory by systematically going round the maze in 
search of food, avoiding wasting time by returning to arms already visited.1C 
A diﬀerent working memory test involves ‘delayed match- to- sample’ tests in a 
Y- shaped maze.2D The bee sees a colour, or smells an odour, at the entrance to
