So, it seems the lineage has evolved to invest more energy in large visual 
neuropils and less in the hemiellipsoid bodies.8D
Could it be that some crustacean lineages have evolved capacities for learn-
ing and memory and then lost them? Indeed, could some lineages have 
evolved sentience and subsequently lost it? That is a possibility we need to 
take seriously, but one that is very hard to establish with conﬁdence, given the 
lack of agreement on markers of the absence of sentience. Ultimately, we

Fig. 12.2 A key ﬁgure from Strausfeld et al. (2020). The pink regions indicate an 
integrative brain region associated with learning and memory (the hemiellipsoid 
body) in various species of crustacean, as identiﬁed using an immunostaining 
technique (N.B. Leptostraca and Stomatopoda are not decapods). Notably, the 
pink regions in penaeid shrimps (Penaeus vannamei) are miniaturized. This 
ﬁgure is by Strausfeld et al. 2020, CC- BY 4.0 licensed. See the original source for 
full details of the technique used.
