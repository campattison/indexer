With elasmobranchs and cyclostomes, where the behavioural evidence is 
thin, the case for sentience candidature rests heavily on the presence of the 
brain regions regarded by Merker’s theory as suﬃcient for sentience. We have 
to make a judgement call: will we accept neural evidence of midbrain mech-
an isms conserved across all vertebrates as enough to establish sentience can-
didature, even in the absence of substantial behavioural evidence? Or is 
behavioural evidence also needed? In 2005, an expert panel of the European 
Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended (on the basis of the neural evi-
dence) that cyclostomes used in science should receive protection (elasmo-
branchs were already protected).17 I agree: in my view, all adult vertebrates 
are sentience candidates.
I say ‘adult’ because the point in development at which the relevant mid-
brain mechanisms come online is poorly understood and will vary across 
species. In the UK and European Union, ﬁshes used in science are considered 
protected animals from ﬁve days (120 hours) afer :edging.18 Remarkably, 
however, studies of zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio) larvae at ﬁve days post- :edging, a 
time when the brain contains around 100,000 neurons19 (compared with 
around 10 million in adults), have found many of the same pain- related 
behaviours found in adults.1; The speed of development of zebraﬁsh is 
astounding, which is part of what makes them so attractive as model organ-
isms for science. The ‘5- day rule’ may well be an error. Juvenile and larval 
ﬁshes should be regarded as investigation priorities.
Proposal 15. All adult vertebrates are sentience candidates. Debates about 
proportionality are warranted in cases where human activities create 
risks  of suﬀering to any adult vertebrate animal. Further investigation 
concerning sentience candidature in vertebrates should focus on juvenile/
larval stages.
Debates about pain in ﬁshes have, at times, had a frustrating character. On 
one side, it has sometimes been suggested that pain in ﬁshes has been ‘dem-
onstrated beyond reasonable doubt’.19 Such claims inevitably attract criticism, 
since ﬁsh lack the neocortical brain regions that some theories of consciousness
