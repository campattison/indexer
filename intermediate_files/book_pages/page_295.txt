14.5 Summary of Chapter 14
Taking invertebrate welfare seriously involves proposing and debating steps 
that may be proportionate (permissible- in- principle, adequate, non- excessive, 
consistent) in relation to speciﬁc welfare risks. The growing interest in inver-
tebrates as potentially sustainable protein sources underlines the need for 
these debates.
A plausibly proportionate step would be to set up a licensing scheme that 
requires companies farming sentience candidates or investigation priorities 
to fund the creation (by independent experts) of codes of good practice, 
where none yet exists. There is one important exception, namely octopus 
farming. It is very unlikely that octopus farming could ever meet reasonable 
expectations regarding animal welfare, and so it would be proportionate to 
ban it outright.
Our current state of knowledge makes it diﬃcult to be conﬁdent that 
slaughter is humane or that stunning is eﬀective. It is easier to be conﬁdent 
about what is inhumane. We should not use live boiling without prior stunning 
in decapods, since this method needlessly risks extending and intensifying 
the suﬀering associated with dying.
