Range of realistic possibilities that must be
taken seriously in practical contexts
Fig. 6.2 A proposed scientiﬁc meta- consensus on the neural system requirements for sentience (the capacity for valenced 
experience). There is no consensus about which position within the reasonable range is correct. However, a meta- consensus can form 
around the idea that positions R1–R5 describe realistic possibilities that must be taken seriously, given current evidence. There can 
also be a meta- consensus on the ordering of these views from less inclusive to more inclusive and on the challenges facing any view 
that falls outside this range. Figure © Jonathan Birch. The free use of the Google Noto Emoji Color Font (for the emojis) is granted
