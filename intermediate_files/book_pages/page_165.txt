Table 8.1 A summary of the PARC tests and the division of labour they induce 
between experts and members of the public.

Aspects calling for 
expert input
Aspects calling for 
public input
Permissibility  
in prin ciple
The response is 
compatible with our 
shared values. Given 
those values, the response 
could in prin ciple form 
part of a proportionate 
response, if  other 
conditions are met.
If the response involves 
suspending rights, 
which rights will be 
suspended and in what 
ways? What other 
harms and costs are 
likely to result from the 
proposed response?
In cases where a 
response is legally 
permissible 
-in-principle, does 
it nonetheless 
depart too far from 
our shared moral 
values to merit 
further 
consideration?
Adequacy
The response either (i) 
re duces the risk to an 
acceptable level or, if this 
is un achiev able, (ii) 
delivers the best level of 
risk reduction that can be 
achieved by any 
permissible-in-principle 
option.
What levels of risk 
reduction are likely to be 
de livered by diﬀerent 
options? Conﬁdence 
levels and probability 
yardsticks should be 
used. If cost-beneﬁt or 
harm-beneﬁt analyses 
are available, the results 
can be presented.
What level of risk 
reduction is 
acceptable, given 
our shared values 
and attitudes 
towards risk, and 
bearing in mind 
that our shared way 
of life requires us to 
tolerate some risks?
Reasonable 
necessity
The response does not 
impose any harms or 
costs (including 
suspensions of rights) 
beyond those reasonably 
necessary to achieve 
adequacy, and minimizes 
any harms or costs that 
are reasonably necessary.
If there are multiple 
permissible ways to 
achieve adequacy, what 
are their comparative 
harms and costs? What 
steps are proposed to 
minimize these harms 
and costs? If any 
cost-beneﬁt or  
harm-beneﬁt analyses 
are available, the results 
can be presented to the 
panel.
Where harms and 
costs are imposed, 
can they be justiﬁed 
to those aﬀected as 
reasonably 
necessary to achieve 
adequate risk 
reduction?
Consistency
The response can be 
reconciled with our 
attitude towards other 
risks, including any new 
risks created by the very 
response under 
consideration. 
Sometimes reconciliation 
can take the form of 
justifying a departure 
from past practice.
What are other 
comparable risks, and 
how have they been 
managed? Will a new 
risks be generated by the 
proposed responses? If 
so, what are they?
Where 
inconsistencies 
arise (e.g. with 
other risks or with 
past precedent), 
should they be 
resolved by 
breaking with past 
practice, or by 
reconsidering our 
response to the 
current risk?
