If the main goal were simply that of avoiding research on human beings 
who are sentience candidates, a signiﬁcantly liberalized legal limit would still 
be proportionate to that goal. However, sceptics of human embryo research 
are ofen driven by concerns unrelated to sentience. The best way to resolve 
this value conﬂict stably and for the long term is through democratic, inclu-
sive processes in which those who oppose liberalization are properly 
represented.
