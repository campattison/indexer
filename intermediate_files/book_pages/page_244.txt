Regarding criterion 7, persistent responses and an unwillingness to resub-
mit to a procedure may be indicative of sensitisation (whereby an animal 
becomes more sensitive in future to a stimulus it has encountered before) 
rather than associative learning. But sensitization is found in animals with no 
central nervous system, such as cnidarians (jellyﬁsh and sea anemones).3( 
This should give us pause, since cnidarians do not have any of the brain 
mechanisms posited to be suﬃcient for sentience by theories in the reasonable 
range R1–R5. We decided that sensitization alone was not relevant evidence, 
whereas some forms of associative learning do provide evidence.
But which forms of associative learning? The evidence from human con-
sciousness science on this question presents a contested and fast- changing 
picture. The simplest forms of classical conditioning, where an unconditioned 
stimulus (US) and a conditioned stimulus (CS) are presented together, over-
lapping in time, can be performed by humans even when the stimuli are pre-
sented subliminally,37 and they can even be performed by the spinal cords of 
rats disconnected from the brain38 and by blindsight patients when the condi-
tioned stimulus is presented in the blind ﬁeld.39 We came to the view that 
simple classical conditioning was too easily achieved to raise the probability 
of sentience to any signiﬁcant degree.
Yet one does not need to go far beyond simple classical conditioning to 
ﬁnd forms of learning that, in humans and other mammals, have been at 
least tentatively linked to consciousness. For example, there is some 
 evidence that trace conditioning, where there is a gap in time (e.g. of one 
second) between the CS and US, and where the conditioned response has 
to be well timed to coincide with the US when it arrives, is facilitated by 
conscious perception in humans.3; Some evidence of conscious facilitation 
also exists for instrumental learning,39 reversal learning (learning that the 
relationship between two stimuli has reversed),(D and the learning of 
‘incongruent’ relationships between stimuli, as when a cue on your lef

3; Clark and Squire (1998); Clark et al. (2002). Greenwald and De Houwer (2017), in one of the 
most careful studies of unconscious conditioning so far conducted, found evidence that subjects 
could learn an association between a US and a subliminal CS as long as the gap between CS oﬀset and 
US onset was 17 milliseconds or less. Since a visual stimulus leaves an imprint on the retina for a few 
milliseconds afer oﬀset, the possibility of unconscious conditioning bridging such tiny gaps is not 
evidence against the involvement of consciousness in bridging longer gaps. The potential relevance of 
trace conditioning to animal consciousness was emphasized by Allen (2004); and more recently by 
Birch et al. (2020a); Birch (2022c); and Droege et al. (2021). Sometimes in the animal literature, the 
importance of a well- timed conditioned response in Clark and Squire’s studies has been lost. The rele-
vance of learning to consciousness more generally has been discussed in depth by Ginsburg and 
Jablonka (2019).
