A global workspace is not just any broadcast mechanism. The global work-
space theory ties conscious experience to a speci2c kind of broadcast mech-
an ism, whereby information from a range of sensory, motor, evaluative, and 
memory systems competes for access to a central workspace. Content that 
enters the workspace is then broadcast back to the input systems, as well as 
onwards to a wide range of consumer systems (see §3.1).4H To provide a min-
imal realization of this architecture, a system would need sensorimotor, 
evalu ative, and mnemonic capabilities.
A team of researchers at AI startup Araya Inc. has claimed that the Perceiver 
architecture (a multimodal variant of the transformer architecture developed 
by DeepMind in 2021, in which various input modules compete for access to 
a central ‘workspace’, which can then output to any of a range of output mod-
ules) implements a minimal global workspace (Fig. 15.1).43 Note that the 
argument here does not rely on any implicit learning from a vast corpus of 
training data. The idea is that the architecture, as intended by the program-
mers, already amounts to a global workspace— and would still do so even if 
we trained the model on a tiny amount of training data.
In 2022–2023, I participated in a multidisciplinary working group, assem-
bled by Patrick Butlin and Rob Long (and including Yoshua Bengio, one of 
the so- called ‘godfathers of AI’), that considered these claims and came to 
quite a sceptical view. To interpret the Perceiver architecture as a global

as a global workspace.

Fig. 15.1 The Perceiver architecture. A multimodal transformer architecture 
developed by DeepMind, said by Juliani et al. (2022) to resemble the global 
workspace theory of consciousness. Various input modules, afer the input is 
modulated by ‘attention’, compete for entry to a workspace which then broadcasts 
to a selected output module. Figure from Juliani et al. (2022), CC- BY 4.0.
