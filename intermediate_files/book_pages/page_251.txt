Table 12.1 A summary of the evidence of sentience in cephalopod molluscs. 
The colours and letters represent our conﬁdence level that the criterion in 
question (column) is satisﬁed by the taxon in question (row). VH (dark green) 
indicates very high conﬁdence, H (light green) indicates high conﬁdence, M 
(dark yellow) indicates medium conﬁdence, L (light yellow) represents low 
conﬁdence, and VL (light grey) represents very low conﬁdence.
