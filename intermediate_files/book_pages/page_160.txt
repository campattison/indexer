A probability yardstick is a standardized protocol for assigning verbal, 
qualitative labels to probability ranges. An inﬂuential example is the PHIA 
(Professional Head of Intelligence Assessment) probability yardstick, widely 
used in UK government circles since 2018 (Fig. 8.1). This yardstick maps the 
terms ‘remote chance’, ‘highly unlikely’, ‘unlikely’, ‘realistic possibility’, ‘likely/
probably’, ‘highly likely’ and ‘almost certain’ to ranges of probabilities.
The PHIA yardstick is far from perfect. To require 40 per cent probability 
before being willing to describe an outcome as a ‘realistic possibility’ seems 
unwarranted. And to call something a ‘remote chance’ when it has a probabil-
ity of 5 per cent seems problematic too (one in twenty is not that remote). 
IDalso fear that the word ‘likely’ covers too big a range, including outcomes 
that are slightly more likely than not (~55 per cent), outcomes that are mod-
erately likely (~60–70 per cent), and outcomes that have a ~75 per cent 
 probability of occurring.
Yet this starting point illustrates the general idea. My proposal is not that 
we adopt this particular yardstick but rather that, in any citizens’ panel, a 
yardstick of some kind should be used to standardize the use of probabilistic 
language. Experts should say, for example: ‘I/we have high conﬁdence that 
Option 1 will reduce the probability of causing harm, and that, although there 
will still be a remote chance of causing harm, this will be much reduced from 
the present situation, where harm is likely.’
Test 3: Reasonable Necessity
Policy responses should not impose harms or costs that go beyond what is rea-
sonably necessary to achieve adequacy. The issue arises because there will oCen 
be a temptation to tack extra measures on to a package that is already adequate.
