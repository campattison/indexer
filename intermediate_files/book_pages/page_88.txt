Sikhism emerged from Hinduism in the ﬁfeenth century. It is, like the 
Abrahamic faiths, monotheistic with a single authoritative scripture (the 
Guru Granth Sahib), yet it retains an Indian outlook on many issues, includ-
ing that of reincarnation. Regarding other animals, the Guru Granth Sahib 
instructs Sikhs to ‘show kindness and mercy to all beings, and realize that the 
Lord is pervading everywhere’ (Ang 508). Around 50–60 percent of Sikhs 
interpret this as requiring vegetarianism.7D
When I re9ect on my visit to Dharamsala, I can see it shaped my thoughts 
on these issues, though not in the way I thought it might. At some level, 
I hoped to ﬁnd what Owen Flanagan claims to have found in The Bodhisattva’s 
Brain: a tradition that has converged, from a very diﬀerent direction, on an 
outlook agreeable to many Western atheists, at least once a few dispensable 
metaphysical commitments are dropped.71 In all honesty, that was not what 
I found at all. The idea of a cycle of rebirth or reincarnation72 is at the core of 
2C Krishna (2022).
7D Corichi (2021).
71 Flanagan (2011).
72 Tibetan Buddhists favour ‘rebirth’. Their deepest disagreement with Hinduism concerns whether 
there is a persisting self or soul (atman) that is reincarnated. On the Tibetan view, a process of rebirth 
occurs, but no persisting thing is reincarnated.
