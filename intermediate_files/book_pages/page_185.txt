Sometimes a clinical decision- making team (including the patient’s family) 
agrees, based on careful consideration of what is known about the patient’s 
values and wishes, that sustaining life is no longer in their best interests. In 
the UK and many other countries, the only legally permitted way of ending 
their life in such cases is through the withdrawal of life- sustaining treatment.
Death can follow quickly if, for example, the patient is reliant on mech an-
ic al ventilation. But many patients stabilize in a condition in which the only 
active medical intervention they need is clinically assisted nutrition and 
hydration (CANH). Decision- making teams can be presented with an ap pal-
ling choice: sustain life inde8nitely, even if this is clearly not in line with the 
patient’s expressed wishes and values, or let them die of multiorgan failure as 
a result of prolonged dehydration and malnutrition. This is a process that can 
take 2–3 weeks.
The weight of that terrible choice rests heavily on the families of patients, 
as Celia and Jenny Kitzinger have documented.92 Their interviews with rela-
tives contain quotations such as the following:99
I can’t imagine that she would ever want to live as she is now. [. . .] but the 
[CANH withdrawal] alternative is too cruel. [. . .] even if they agreed to it, it’s 
too painful, you know. I couldn’t do that. [. . .] You know, we couldn’t put her 
through it.
When they told me that I felt like screaming. I thought, ‘you are MAD!’ I didn’t 
even contemplate it. I just don’t understand how anyone can sanction that law.
I couldn’t believe that that [CANH withdrawal] was the method. Everybody 
I’ve talked to has said, ‘there must be better ways than that in this day and 
age.’ [. . .] What a stupid, stupid way of doing it.
I just couldn’t bear that he was starving [. . .] I just thought, what a horrible— 
what a dreadful way to live your last days. I just thought it was awful.
We all thought [CANH withdrawal] was barbaric. But then being kept alive 
that way is barbaric [. . .] I mean it [death following CANH withdrawal] is 
better than forever living that way. But really, truthfully, what the hell is this? 
The system has to be in place where if [surgery and rehabilitation] is a fail-
ure, if it hasn’t worked, then you can help that person die with dignity.
I would view it [a lethal injection] as a kinder decision. [. . .] Because if you 
stop feeding them, they are going to die. If you’ve made that decision, you 
might as well do it as humanely as you possibly can. [. . .] To starve some-
body to death seems a particularly cruel thing to do.
