Unusually for a brain region, it is unpaired— there is only one— apparently 
hinting at a unifying or integrative role.
The hypothesis that such a structure might have a special function relating 
to consciousness was, at the time, a sensible one to put forward, but we now 
know it to be false. The pineal gland produces melatonin, a hormone im port-
ant to the regulation of circadian rhythms. It is not part of the neural basis of 
consciousness or sentience. Damage to the pineal gland can be very disrup-
tive to a person’s circadian rhythms, but it does not abolish sentience or even 
partially impair conscious experience (compare with this, for example, blind-
sight, which involves damage to the visual cortex and leads to dramatic al ter-
ations to conscious experience, discussed in Chapter 5).4
Now imagine someone who simply will not accept the modern view of the 
pineal gland. They think Descartes is the only credible authority on questions 
of consciousness and insist his theory was correct. There is no need to read 
this new evidence, they say, because if it disagrees with Descartes it must be 
wrong. You would not take this person seriously— why not? Not because you 
have a complete, empirically well- established theory of sentience that tells us 
conclusively where its neural basis is located. No one has this. The problem is 
not that this person has a controversial view, but that this person is failing to 
respond to new evidence. To 5atly ignore relevant evidence is another way of 
being unreasonable.
