Frontiers of Proportionality
14.1 Taking Invertebrates Seriously
The label ‘sentience candidate’, in my framework, is not just an empty honor-
iﬁc, a pat on the back for achieving a certain level of nervous system com-
plexity. It is supposed to trigger a serious, evidence- based discussion about 
what constraints on our behaviour it is proportionate to accept, so that we 
can all fulﬁl our shared duty to avoid causing gratuitous suﬀering.
I can imagine someone who thinks: in that case, invertebrates cannot pos-
sibly be sentience candidates, because the idea of changing our behaviour to 
take account of their interests is just too ludicrous to contemplate. Peter 
Carruthers once expressed a view along these lines:
It is a ﬁxed point for me that invertebrates make no direct claims on us, 
despite possessing minds in the sense that makes sympathy and moral con-
cern possible. Invertebrates believe things, want things, and make simple 
plans, and they are capable of having their plans thwarted and their desires 
frustrated. But it is not wrong to take no account of their suﬀering. Indeed, 
I would regard the contrary belief as a serious moral perversion. And I suspect 
that most ordinary folk will agree.1
Carruthers himself can see the problem with a worldview in which the 
presence or absence of a backbone ends up carrying immense ethical sig-
niﬁcance. That is not the view he endorses in this article. Instead, he takes 
the patent absurdity of moral obligations concerning invertebrates to cast 
doubt on the idea that we have moral obligations concerning non- human 
vertebrates, including our fellow great apes, primates, and mammals, 
beyond the minimal indirect duties described in his earlier book The 
Animals Issue (see §4.2).
