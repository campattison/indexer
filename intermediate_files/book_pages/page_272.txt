The idea of insects as sentience candidates sometimes provokes incredu-
lous reactions. ‘How can we live our lives if we regard insects as sentient? Are 
you saying I can’t step on an insect while walking? That I can’t drive a car?’. 
But this reaction takes no account of the concept of proportionality. What is 
needed is a discussion about proportionality in which we reﬂect on what 
steps might make sense, given our duty to avoid causing gratuitous suﬀering. 
Suﬀering accidentally metred out by humans in the process of walking or 
driving is not likely to be deemed gratuitous. I will return to this issue in the 
next chapter. But :rst, let us turn our attention from sentience candidates to 
investigation priorities.
13.4 Four Investigation Priorities
Gastropod Molluscs
When thinking about how the class of sentience candidates might expand in 
the future, my thoughts turn :rst to the gastropod molluscs, which have on 
the order of tens to hundreds of thousands of neurons (about 10,000–20,000 
in the model organism Aplysia californica, a sea slug).81 Their brains consist 
of three pairs of ganglia arranged in a ring around the oesophagus.82 In large 
gastropods like Aplysia, the brain volume can be quite large, but this is 
because some of the neurons themselves are enormous: a single Aplysia 
 neuron can have the volume of the entire brain of Drosophila.88 But we have 
no reason to consider neuron number or brain volume reliable guides to sen-
tience candidature. Brain volume (holding :xed neuron count) is likely 
ir rele vant, and neuron number provides only very weak evidence. Better to 
ask whether there is evidence of standard pain markers and/or of evaluative 
modelling, working memory, and/or a central association unit integrating 
inputs from many sensory sources.
There is ample evidence of classical conditioning in Aplysia sea slugs, 
focusing on classical conditioning of the siphon and gill withdrawal re ﬂexes.89 
Much of the learning seems ‘limited’ in Ginsburg and Jablonka’s sense, with 
no clear evidence of rich multisensory integration, learning about novel 
stimuli, or learning across temporal gaps.8; Classical conditioning with
