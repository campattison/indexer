6.1 Uncertainty, Inconclusiveness, and Dissensus
When thinking about the edge of sentience, we face multiple levels of uncer-
tainty and disagreement concerning the metaphysics, functions, neural basis, 
and ethical signiﬁcance of valenced experience (see Chapters 3–5). Figure 6.1 
summarizes the picture that emerged from that part of the book. Empirical 
evidence of many diﬀerent kinds bears on the issue for an open- minded per-
son, but it never seems enough to end the dispute. The evidence is never con-
clusive, and we cannot see a path to conclusive evidence from where we are 
now. Even if we could settle the scientiﬁc aspects of the questions conclusively, 
disagreement about values would remain.
